The last submission of this project was marked to have left trailing whitespaces. Upon attempting to observe these trailing whitespaces, I have found none.

Either way, I ran the files through sublime with whitespace enabled, and performed 'trim trailing whitespace on save' functionality. If there is any whitespace that is still eluding me, please indicate where it was found in the feedback.
